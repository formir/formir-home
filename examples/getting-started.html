    <p class="has-tooltip" data-tooltip="but some of cases will be necessary, I will give you know">Formir is a framework that not require any JS code to fully work</p>
    <p>All of logic are based on CSS and <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> tag elements, thats are required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> tag has a three very important attribute for Formir, there is: <code>name</code>, <code>id</code>, and <code>for</code>
      <br/>
      <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> is part of  form on your website, but we can hide this elements and control all other elements that are directly <code>+</code> or indirectly <code>~</code> behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start working with Formir, you mast know that all elements <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> ascending one group must have the same name, for example all <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> in component 'tabs' have to set the same <code>name</code> attribute.
      <br/>
      Parts of Formir components have to also set <code>id</code> attribute for each <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> and have his own <code>&#x3C;label/&#x3E;</code>
      with associated <code>for</code> attribute (the same as <code>id</code>)

  <h2>Get Formir</h2>
  <article class="section section-content with-padding">
    <p>Use npm install: <code>npm install formir</code></p>
  </article>
  <h2>Setup Formir</h2>
  <article class="section section-content with-padding">
    <p>Formir is writen on LESS. Files are split by core elements, template elements that is an extention to core, and application files that will be not part of component of formir but it will be your own styles.</p>
    <p>Start with install or copy framework files to own direction. All files are included in file: <code>less/formir.less</code> you could also use example of application in file <code>application.less</code> - this is a compilation for this page. All start with this file - you could remove or change the direction, copy from vendor to your direction and modify.</p>
    <p>All classes used on this framework is customisable to prevent name collision - <code>less/setup/classes.less</code></p>
    <p>All core variables - the most important for all components are store in - <code>less/setup/core.less</code> for example number of columns for grid, or unit for each dimention variables, RWD breaking points.</p>
    <p>All other variables for each components are store in - <code>less/setup/variables.less</code>.</p>
    <p>Mixins are store in direction - <code>less/core/mixins/</code> there is a lot of prefix function.</p>
    <p>In core there is a logic of css, we dont't remomment to change this files, use variables or templates file mixins (each components template has own class mixin to do the job) - but feel free if such a need arises. Remember to copy all files that will be changes from node_modules and change the include direction.</p>
